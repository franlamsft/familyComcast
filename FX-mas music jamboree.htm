            If you want to listen to what was originally in the score here are three .mp3 
            renditions. Note the addition of at least a tiny beat. My suggestion was for 
            someone to keep time by hitting a box with stick and another pie plate with 
            screws in it as the &quot;cymbal&quot;. In these renditions you have real drum sounds.</p>
    <p>
        Also these computer musicians use a lot of vibrato - possibly too much.</p>

        To see a score view of these pieces that plays like a piano roll, you will have 
        to install the Scorch plug-in from Avid Sibelius. It&#39;s safe and is in common 
        usage. The page will walk you through that. There are versions for all browsers.</p>
